# Book Recommendation System Project

Welcome to the Book Recommendation System Project! In this project, we perform a comprehensive analysis of a book dataset obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset we used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset).

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a book recommendation system that helps users discover new books based on their preferences and interests. We've conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset, which includes various book-related information such as titles, authors, genres, and user ratings.

## Features and Technologies Used

- **Data Analysis:** We have explored and cleaned the dataset to gain insights into the world of books, identifying trends, popular genres, and highly-rated books.

- **Web Page:** To make book recommendations accessible to users, we've developed a user-friendly web page using HTML and CSS. Bootstrap is used to enhance the page's design and responsiveness.
